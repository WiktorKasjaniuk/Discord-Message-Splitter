# Discord Message Splitter
One algorithm Python library, free for anyone to grab and use without any credit or permission.
Used by Discord Python bots to smartly split long messages into smaller ones in order to cope with the 2000 character per message limit.
Longer messages can also be sent by bots with Discord Nitro subscribed, thus please remember to help Discord grow when writting a bigger project.
